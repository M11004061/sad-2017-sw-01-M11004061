# New York City Restaurant Guide

This is a simple MEAN Stack application that allows a user to search for different types of restaurants in NYC. Additionally a user can add new restaurants to the guide, update existing entries and delete old entries if a restaurant does not exist anymore. The application supports a basic CRUD REST API for the restaurants entity.
